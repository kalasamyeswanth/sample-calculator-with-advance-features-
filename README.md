INTRODUCTION:

This Python script implements a versatile calculator capable of evaluating mathematical expressions with advanced features. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting expressions and obtaining accurate results. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced features like exponentiation and parentheses for grouping.
Our Simple Calculator is the perfect tool for anyone looking to perform basic arithmetic calculations quickly and easily. With a large and easy-to-use interface, this calculator is simple and intuitive, making it perfect for users of all ages and levels of experience.

Implementation:
	Python is a programming language that utilizes the arithmetic operations 
	Here in python programming language we use the math module The Python math module offers you the ability to perform common and useful mathematical calculations within your application.
	Using Python math module we can perform many mathematical operation for easy way of calculation in the modern world

CODE EXPLAINATION:
Python Functions:
	add(self, num): set of code to perform a task to make the addition the numeric operands
	subtract(self, num): set of code to perform a task to make the subtraction the numeric operands
	multiply(self, num): set of code to perform a task to make the multiply the numeric operands
	divide(self, num): set of code to perform a task to make the dividing the numeric operands
	power(self, num): set of code to perform a task to make the power of numeric operands
	factorial(self, num): set of code to perform a task to make the factorial of a numeric operands

Main function:
__main__ is the name of the environment where top-level code is run. “Top-level code” is the first user-specified Python module that starts running. It’s “top-level” because it imports all other modules that the program needs. Sometimes “top-level code” is called an entry point to the application.
__main__:
In each of these situations, the top-level module’s __name__ is set to '__main__'
As a result, a module can discover whether or not it is running in the top-level environment by checking its own __name__, which allows a common idiom for conditionally executing code when the module is not initialized from an import statement:
This is where using the if __name__ == '__main__' code block comes in handy. Code within this block won’t run unless the module is executed in the top-level environment.
Putting as few statements as possible in the block below if __name__ == '__main__' can improve code clarity and correctness.

USAGE:
Here the user enter a numberic value first and user select which operation should be perform here, after selection angain enter a operands value again to continue computer would be asked to perform or quit.  Here at any time we can quit the calculation at any time we need be select quit option.
Here we will be perform few advance feactures which implements in a simple calculator are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation and quit options 


CONCLUSION:
With its support for basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, and parentheses, this calculator provides users with a powerful tool for performing a wide range of mathematical calculations. Its intuitive interface and accurate results make it a valuable asset for anyone in need of a flexible and reliable calculator solution.
